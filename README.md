# Onboarding assignment 5

## Objectives:

- To design and implement an online newsletter subscription service provider.
- To learn and understand the working, internals and the solution that each of the technologies
  (which will be used in the stack) provide.

Technologies used:

- *Java, Spring boot* - All microservices that you build should be a spring boot service.
- *Kafka* - All asynchronous communications between your microservices can be done using kafka
  efficiently.
- *Hibernate/ Spring Data* - The database to be used could be a MySQL DB and be bridged with your
  spring boot application using hibernate or spring data.
- *Redis* - API Request level and global level caching can be done using Redis.
- *Elastic search* - Indexing your subscription list for searches would be served appropriately
  using elastic search.
- *Docker* - Dockerize your micro-service
